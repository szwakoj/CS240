This goes for plagiarizing code from other sources, such as StackOverflow, Reddit, Github, other uncited sources, and fellow students.</p> <p>That being said, using other sources as reference is not completely out of the question. Peers, tutorials, YouTube videos, existing code, and even LLMs can greatly aid in understanding complex topics.
