# Glossary

**Computational Problems**: Problems that specify constraints on an input-output relationship.

**Instance**: A single valid input that satisfies the constraints of the problem's intended inputs. Each instance is an example of a possible problem from the formal definition.

**Algorithms**: Solutions to computational problems. They take in a possible instance of the problem and are expected to produce a valid output. The transformation is done using a discrete number of ordered computational steps.

**Correct Algorithm**: An algorithm that halts with the correct output for every input instance. A correct algorithm solves the given computational problem and must terminate in finite time.

**Incorrect Algorithm**: An algorithm that solves only a subset of the possible instances of a computational problem.

**Data Structure**: Methods of storing and organizing data in some medium that allows for easy access and modification.

**Array**: Ordered numbers in a set size of contiguous memory, meaning that all data is stored physically next to each other.
