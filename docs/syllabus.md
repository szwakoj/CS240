## Text and Materials:

There is no required text book, most if not all material will be through this site and in class lectures. There are, however suggested resources for those who learn best with a textbook as reference, as well as the sources for the course.

"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS) (3rd edition)

- Textbook that covers the topics in the traditional way, at times it will be referenced

https://en.cppreference.com/ - C and C++ Reference Website

- We will regularly use this as our reference for in-class demos on C and C++

## Course Schedule:

Below is the rough topical structure of the course in the order of coverage, you can find this plan and the most updated schedule at the course website. The schedule is a rough outline and will be changed to best serve the classes needs, any changes made will be in favor of the students and any complications can be rectified over email or in-person.

These units are a rough organization of the topics in the order covered, they will be about 2-3 weeks each with some time allotted for tests and review. More or less time could be taken depending on the class pace, the latter allowing for more topics to be covered.

## Accommodations for Students with Accessibility Needs at SUNY Polytechnic Institute:

Your access in this course is important to me. In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, SUNY Polytechnic Institute is committed to ensuring comprehensive educational access and accommodations for all registered students seeking access to meet course requirements and fully participate in programs and activities. Students with documented disabilities, temporary, or medical conditions are encouraged to request services by contacting Student Accessibility Services (SAS) or filling out the Request for Accommodations form. Please note, requesting accommodations is only the first step. You must provide documentation (the request form may count) to SAS and meet with staff before receiving accommodations. Please do this as early as possible 1) because accommodations are never retroactive and 2) so that we have adequate time to arrange your approved academic accommodation/s.

Once SAS creates your accommodation plan, it is your responsibility to provide me a copy of the accommodation plan. If you experience any access barriers in this course, such as with printed content, graphics, online materials, etc., reach out to me or SAS right away.

## Content Accessibility

SUNY Poly’s goal is for all digital content to be fully accessible but there may be times when remediation is still underway, please let me know if you experience challenges accessing any digital content in this course.

This course is attempting to start a new standard for the CS department using open-source tools to make content universally accessible according to any accessibility requirements by producing all content sources in Markdown. By creating it in Markdown and pure text, any accessibility reader can be tooled to a students needs, while allowing for the teacher to rapidly create material in a lasting way.

This process will not be without its bumps, so, if there are any issues with accessing the course material or reading it in any way, please contact me ASAP by email at szwakoj@sunypoly.edu.

## Writing and Communications Center

The Writing and Communications Center (WCC) is here to support all of SUNY Poly’s writers: students, faculty, and staff. We offer one-on-one in-person and remote consultations for writers working on a range of projects at any stage of the writing process (from idea generation to final revisions). WCC consultants work with writers on idea development, brainstorming, content development, structure, source use, style, grammar, punctuation, and more. While we are not a proofreading or editing service and we do not comment on grades, we offer strategies and resources writers can use as they compose, revise, edit, and learn to proofread their own work. The WCC is located on the first floor of the Cayan Library. You can learn more about the WCC or make an appointment by visiting our website: https://sunypoly.edu/writingcenter.html.

## Plagiarism Warning

All homeworks, quizzes, tests, and labs are meant to be completed by students independently (unless otherwise stated) and without the assistance of generative AI backed by LLMs including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and all other text/code generators. All material that is assigned to students is meant to instill lasting critical thinking and problem solving skills that are required to excel in both this course and wherever students may end up in the future. As such, usage of these tools in a fashion akin to plagiarism (not citing, wholesale copying, intent to hide sources) is strictly prohibited in this course. All incidents that can be proven must be brought to the dean and always results in a zero on the grade. This goes for plagiarizing code from other sources, such as StackOverflow, Reddit, Github, other uncited sources, and fellow students.

That being said, using other sources as reference is not completely out of the question. Peers, tutorials, YouTube videos, existing code, and even LLMs can greatly aid in understanding complex topics. However, they cannot be used without disclosure and proper citation if being used extensively in an assignment. Use other sources and LLMs cautiously as this course is based on the lessons found within the the lectures given in-person.

## Policy on Submission of Assignments

All assignments will be submitted via Brightspace in the appropriate location identified by each assignment. Specific instructions can be found on the course website.
Each assignment will be given with an intended due date attached. For each day late an assignment is, a 10% reduction will be removed from the maximum possible grade, capped at 50%, so long as a valid final submission has been made by the end of the semester.

## Policy on Missed Classes, Make-up Work, and/or Extra Credit:

There is no method of attendance other than the attendance quizzes given weekly. Make-up attendance quizzes are not allowed due to being a measure of how often students come to the class and the dropping of the three lowest grades before final grading. Make-up unit tests are allowed if there is good reason and preferably known about ahead of time.

Extra credit may be given, in this event it will be announced in-class.

## Cancellation of Classes Due to Inclement Weather or Other Emergency:

SUNY Poly has a 24-hour hotline, called Snowline, to inform students, faculty, and staff when severe weather prompts the cancellation of all classes. Snowline can be reached by calling 315-792-7385. In the event of severe weather, Snowline will announce only the cancellation of ALL classes. The cancellation of all classes will also be posted online and broadcast on radio and television stations in the Utica Rome and Syracuse areas. The SUNY Poly website also maintains a list of individual class cancellations.

In addition, all SUNY Poly students and employees are enrolled in the Rave Alert emergency alert service. You can visit the SUNY Poly Rave Alert website to learn more and to adjust your notification preferences.
