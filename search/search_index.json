A correct algorithm cannot sometimes give a correct answer on a given instance, and sometimes run infinitely as a possibility, it must stop.</p> <p>Algorithms can be incorrect and solve only a subset of the possible instances of a computational problem. In these cases, we can assess what percentage of cases the algorithm solves for. While it may seem nonsensical and undesirable to have an algorithm that doesn't always work, there are times it can be beneficial, we will take a look at those at a later date. For the short-term, we will mostly be looking at algorithms that solve certain computational problems completely and are correct. </p> <p>Let's compare the correctness of two algorithms:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Algorithm: 404 Not Found</p> <ul> <li>Input: <ul> <li>An array \\(A\\) of \\(n\\) numbers \\([ a_0 , a_1, ..., a_{n-1} ]\\), where \\(n &gt; 0\\)</li> <li>Target number \\(t\\)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Output: -1</li> <li>Procedure:<ul> <li>\\(\\text{return } -1\\)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Algorithm: Linear Search</p> <ul> <li>Input: <ul> <li>An array \\(A\\) of \\(n\\) numbers \\([ a_0 , a_1, ..., a_{n-1} ]\\), where \\(n &gt; 0\\)</li> <li>Target number \\(t\\)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Output:  The smallest index \\(\\text{i where } A[i]=t, or \u22121\\) if no such index exists</li> <li>Procedure:<ol> <li>\\(\\text{for } i \\gets 0 \\text{ to } n-1 \\text{ do:}\\)<ol> <li>\\(\\text{if } A[i] = t \\text{ then:}\\)<ol> <li>\\(\\text{return } i\\)</li> </ol> </li> <li>\\(\\text{end if}\\)</li> </ol> </li> <li>\\(\\text{end for}\\)</li> <li>\\(\\text{return } -1\\)</li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Obviously, \"404 Not Found\" is an incomplete algorithm, it always assumes that the target number is not in the input array. For Linear Search, however, we can be pretty sure that it will work for all instances of the problem. There are ways to test this, and we will take a look at those at a later date.</p> <p>Another way to assess an algorithm, is by how fast it runs. While it may not be true 100% of the time, in instances where the target number is not within the input array, \"404 Not Found\" will be faster than \"Linear Search\". </p> <p>No mater what input array given, \"404 Not Found\" will produce an output in a single computational step. If that computational step took 1 second, no matter the size of \\(n\\), or the size of the input array, \"404 Not Found\" will always take 1 second to complete. \"Linear Search\" on the other hand requires many more computational steps to complete. Mainly, it loops through each element of the array until the end in the event of the target not existing. At each iteration of the loop there is a comparison operation, if we take the 1 second time estimate from before then we get a time of \\(n\\) seconds if the target doesn't exist. </p> <p>While this is a simple example, this process can be done on any algorithm and estimate its so called time complexity, a future topic.</p>"},{"location":"lessons/1_introduction/#data-structures","title":"Data Structures","text":"<p>Each of the previous examples works on some form of data. Mostly arrays, or ordered numbers in a set size of contiguous memory. This will be covered more in C Review and later in the data structures lessons, but it means that all data is stored physically next to each other. This creates some limitations with working with it as a medium of data in an algorithm. For example, to remove an element, all elements to the right of it must be shifted down by one in order to fill the empty space left by the removed element. This can be computationally expensive if you are removing and adding elements very quickly to different parts of the array during the run of an algorithm. In other cases, the way you represent the data can make solving problems faster.</p> <p>The way you represent data for a given problem is called the data structure. Data structures are methods of storing and organizing data in some medium that allows for easy access and modification.

When you run a Python script, the interpreter reads each line, translates it to machine instructions, and executes it immediately. This makes development faster since you can test code quickly, but execution tends to be slower since the machine instructions are not always written in the most efficient manner out-of-the-box.</p> <p>Compiled languages, like C and C++, accomplish this task in a different way. Instead of being executed by and interpreter at runtime, C programs are compiled and converted to low-level machine code before runtime. Essentially, compiled languages are translated into machine code at compile time for the target system to produce an executable that can be ran without recompilation or interpretation. This leads to faster programs and more fine-grained control over what happens during the course of your program</p> <p>This process involves four primary steps:</p> <ol> <li>Preprocessing: The C preprocessor (CPP) formats the source code using macros like <code>#include</code> or <code>#define</code>, applying any user-defined changes before passing to the next step</li> <li>Compilation: The compiler translates C source code into assembly language</li> <li>Assembly: The assembler then converts the assembly code into machine code, producing object files, <code>.o</code> or <code>.obj</code>, as a result</li> <li>Linking: The linker orders the object files properly and combines them into a single executable program that is ready to run on the target system</li> </ol> <p>The following are the commands to compile a simple C program, using the GNU C Compiler: <pre><code># Compile source.c into an executable named program\ngcc source.c -o program\n# Run the executable\n./program\n</code></pre> In this simple program, all of the main steps are hidden from the user, however we can use compiler flags to view some of the intermediate files:</p> <ul> <li><code>-E</code>: Stops after preprocessing stage</li> <li><code>-S</code>: Stops compilation after generating assembly code</li> <li><code>-c</code>: Stops compilation after generating object files, preventing linking</li> </ul>"},{"location":"lessons/2_reviewing_c/#basics","title":"Basics","text":"<p>Now that we have reviewed how to compile and run our programs, let's go over the the fundamental building blocks of C programming.</p> <p>The following is a standard \"Hello World!\" program written in C: <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(int argc, const char* argv[])\n{\n    printf(\"Hello CS240!\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre></p> <ol> <li><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> - This is a preprocessor macro to include the <code>stdio.h</code> file at the beginning of this source code file.</li> <li><code>int main(){}</code> - The main function, our main entry point into executing code on the computer.
